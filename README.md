# DiVAS.

## Overview
In this project, I am trying to create a software that optimizes my daily schedule. The background theory is based on neurobiology - No screen 1 hour before sleep, etc. The flow is that I'll probably download TinyLlama (coz of space) and use DPO to fine tune it for neurobiology. A sanity check would be to ask it so solve a basic physics questions and it SHOULD fail.

There are two key steps - 
    1. Google Calendar Binding (done)
    2. DPO on the LLM (doing)
